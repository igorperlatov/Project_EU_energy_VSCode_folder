EU Energy Sector Performance Analysis

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing key performance indicators in the EU energy sector for the years 2015-2019 and 2021. 
The data was sourced from the dane.gov.pl website. You can access the original dataset here https://shorturl.at/mO5Oc.

Data Preparation
The original raw tables were not ready for analysis, so several preprocessing steps were undertaken:

Translation and Renaming:

All Polish words were translated to English.
Column names were renamed for clarity.

Dataset Division:

The main table was divided into four separate datasets.
Each dataset was saved as a CSV file with a primary key (id) representing the country or EU abbreviation.

Column Renaming and Shortening:

Columns were renamed or shortened to make the datasets easier to work with.
Datasets
The project includes four main tables, each described in a separate description file. These tables are now ready for analysis in various contexts.
