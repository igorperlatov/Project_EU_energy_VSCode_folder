<b><h1>EU Energy Sector Performance Analysis</h1></b>

<b><h2>Overview</h2></b>
This project focuses on analyzing key performance indicators in the EU energy sector for the years 2015-2019 and 2021. The data was sourced from the dane.gov.pl website. You can access the original dataset here.

<b><h2>Data Preparation</h2></b>
The original raw tables were not ready for analysis, so several preprocessing steps were undertaken:
1. Translation and Renaming:
    - All Polish words were translated to English.
    - Column names were renamed for clarity.
2. Dataset Division:
    - The main table was divided into four separate datasets.
    - Each dataset was saved as a CSV file with a primary key (id) representing the country or EU abbreviation.
3. Column Renaming and Shortening:
    - Columns were renamed or shortened to make the datasets easier to work with.

<b><h2>Datasets</h2></b>
The project includes four main tables, each described in a separate description file. These tables are now ready for analysis in various contexts.

<b><h2>Next Steps</h2></b>
1. Define Analysis Goals:
    - Determine the specific outputs and insights we want to derive from the data.
2. Perform Analysis:
    - Use the prepared datasets to conduct the analysis and generate the desired outputs.

<b><h2>Getting Started</h2></b>
To start working with the data, follow these steps:
1. Download the CSV files from the repository.
2. Refer to the description file for details on each table.
3. Use your preferred data analysis tools to explore and analyze the data.
